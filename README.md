## Description

This Project was to demonstrate my ablility to utilize MySQL backend applications. This challenge intoduced us to mysq12 and bringing back earlier skills like prompt users to interact with the code. By given a prompt in the terminal the user may view various components to there Employee Tracker. I took a different route by sending a command to the terminal through MySQL when ask to add or delete or view all content selected. 

## Usage
-log into mysql then enter source db/schema.sql; then source db/seeds.sql; to get up to date table content and get any deleted content.

-By opening the command terminal and entering node server.js you are given a choice prompt.

-By selecting view(all department, all roles, all employees) you are given a table with your requested content.

-By selecting add(department, role, employee) you are prompted with questions pertaining to the selected choice to add, then shown an updated table with the new content displayed.

-By selecting delete(department, role, employee) you are prompted with questions pertaining to the selected choice to delete, then shown an updated table with the new content displayed.
